# LinuxMint_Toolbox

A collection of setup and personalization scripts/snippets for Linux Mint

Since this project is highly personalized (won't fit all kinds of people), you would in the ideal case derive some use
out of its ad-hoc solutions to a specific problem or adopt some creative ideas you didn't consider or knew existed
before.<br>

## WARNING: operations as root

Large portions of the scripts, by their nature, require root permissions to run.
Run them or do as they suggest at **your own risk**.<br>
As with any code you'd find on the internet, it's highly recommended that you try to understand what you're running,
    and perform backups of any data that's being modified or put at risk.


## How to use

Since this is a mere collection of snippets, you're just supposed to run or read them.<br>

## Limitations

The snippets fit Linux Mint 21 or Linux Mint 21.1

Portions of them may also fit other Debian distros or Linux in general.

## Future Improvements

The scripts/snippets are not final, these improvements will be added gradually:
* Re-checking (in case some features broke after adding new ones)
* More verbosity / better feedback from various terminal commands
* Adding new features/ideas
* Cleanup
* Implementation of various TODOs (which are mixed within; sorry, but that's my way of keeping work-management minimal)


If you have any improvements to suggest, please do contact me or make a pull request.
