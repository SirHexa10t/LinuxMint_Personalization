# The following was written/tested on a Synology DS1520+,  running DSM 7.1.1

# Hardware specs by model name: (according to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RbAiqWf-mQ )
# [lettr_code][XX][YY]?
# letter_code:   DS: Disk Station , FS: Flash Series (SSD only) , SA: SAS , RS: Rack Station , NVR: Network Video Recorder (has GPU and does video-related workloads)
# XX: max number of drives that the device can potentially support (it's taking 5 extra per expansion port into consideration). It's DANGEROUS to add external drives, as a failed connection could render your externally added drives unusable!
# YY: year that the model was released in
# ?:  +: support for extra software features (docker / VMs, BTRFS) , slim: 2.5" bays version , XS: extra storage (but weaker processing power) , RP: redundant power-supply , J: simplest (doesn't support BTRFS)


# Upgrade your device with an M.2 NVMe SSD for caching. # TODO - find what's the optimal ratio of total storage to cache storage 

# Consider upgrading your RAM if you're using the NAS for applications usage. Also, RAM is used for cache while writing.

# Due to rewrite requirements when running out of space in SMR drives, you should avoid them. Get CMR drives.
#   You might get really good drives by shucking external drives. It's a gamble.


# Choosing RAID:  if you don't know much about RAID, read this: https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/StorageManager/storage_pool_what_is_raid?version=7
# If you have several (4+) drives, you'd want to use SHR (besides, you bought a Synology device, so make use of this option)
#   You can simulate the effect of choosing any specific RAID strategy on this page: https://www.synology.com/en-us/support/RAID_calculator
# In SHR1/SHR2, you can lose up to 1 / 2 drive(s) of largest capacity, accordingly. 10% extra data will be taken away by DSM
#   There are some great advantages to SHR which won't be explained in this file.

# For filesystem, I suggest BTRFS. Won't be explained here either.



Convenience:
------------
User & Group > Advanced -> make sure you don't have Password Expiration
    Set-up a strong password, don't rely on password expiration.

# TODO - integrate SSH access

Hardware & Power > General > Power Recovery -> Restart automatically after a power failure
    Could cause damage if you encounter another power-out as the device boots



Security (if it's accessible to the internet)
--------
Security > Protection -> Enable auto block
    Put in something like 100 Login attempts every 30 minutes. It'll block brute-force attacks, but not block out users who forgot their password.

Make sure admin account is disabled.

Person (top right corner) > Personal -> Sign-in Method -> Enable 2-Factor Authentication

Login Portal > DSM -> change the DSM port
    Slightly more secure than using the well-known default one.

# TODO - add a regular user that'll be used regularly instead of the initial Admin one



Utilities:
----------
Open the NAS to the world
    Port-forward https DSM ports on your router
    Modify the NAS's firewall

# TODO - integrate VPN

# TODO - integrate Docker

# TODO - integrate Pi-Hole

# TODO - you can access the NAS with DDNS if you setup a Synology account; you can get a subdomain name in .synology.me 

# TODO - torrent downloads?

# TODO - integrate surveillance camera feed

# TODO - might want to use Active Insight (requires account) for problem reports


Maintenance and data safety:
----------------------------
HDD/SSD > Task Scheduler
    Make sure you have a monthly S.M.A.R.T tests
    
Storage > <pool> > Schedule Data Scrubbing
    Check for errors (bit-rot) on your disks on off-hours. Every 3 months or so.    

# TODO - use hyper-backup to backup important files to another place

# TODO - If you're using BTRFS, enable Snapshot Replication

# TODO - snapshot replication (BTRFS feature)

# TODO - UPS integration:  Hardware & Power > UPS -> Time before DiskStation enters Safe Mode
    You set x minutes of running on UPS before restart deciding to shut down
